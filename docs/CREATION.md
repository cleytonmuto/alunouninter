I just ingressed a math bachelor course and want to create a weekly blog to register my learning and growing thorugh the time. Any suggestions about what to publish?

Love this idea. A weekly math blog can become  *gold* —for learning, reflection, and even future opportunities.

Here’s a structure that works especially well for math students and keeps content flowing even when the week feels “unproductive.”

---

## Core Weekly Sections (simple & sustainable)

### 1. **What I Learned This Week**

Not a summary of lectures—focus on  *insights* .

* A concept that finally clicked
* A definition that changed how you think
* A theorem you now see everywhere

👉 Example:

> “This week I stopped thinking of limits as formulas and started seeing them as promises.”

---

### 2. **One Problem Worth Remembering**

Pick **one** problem that mattered.

* Why it was hard
* Where you got stuck
* The moment it broke open

This is *very* compelling to readers and future-you.

---

### 3. **Mistakes I Made (and Why They Matter)**

This is rare and powerful.

* A misconception you had
* A “false proof” you almost believed
* A shortcut that failed

Math growth is mostly mistake-driven—document it.

---

### 4. **Connections**

Train yourself to see math as a web.

* Links between courses (e.g. calculus ↔ linear algebra)
* Math ↔ philosophy ↔ computer science ↔ physics
* A visual or analogy that helped

---

### 5. **Emotional + Mental State Check**

This sounds soft—but it’s crucial.

* When math felt beautiful
* When it felt impossible
* Motivation dips and recoveries

Over time, this becomes a  *map of your resilience* .

---

## Optional Rotating Sections (use 1–2 per week)

### 🔁 “Explain It Like I’m 12”

Rewrite a concept in plain language.
If you can do this, you *really* understand it.

---

### 🧠 “Questions I Don’t Understand Yet”

List open confusions:

* “Why does this definition have to be this way?”
* “Is this always true or just in this course?”

Unanswered questions make great future posts.

---

### 📚 “From the Book / Lecture”

* A quote, diagram, or paragraph that struck you
* Why it mattered

---

### 🛠 Tools & Habits

* Study techniques that worked (or didn’t)
* How you take notes
* How you review proofs
* Time-management experiments

---

## Long-Term Series Ideas (very powerful)

* **“My Relationship With Proofs”** (monthly)
* **“From Computation to Abstraction”**
* **“Concepts That Scared Me at First”**
* **“What I’d Tell My Past Self This Week”**

---

## Tone Advice (important)

* Write **for yourself first**
* Be honest, not polished
* You’re not teaching experts—you’re documenting growth

Paradoxically, this makes the blog *more* valuable.

---

## Practical Tip (don’t skip this)

Keep a **running draft** during the week:

* Dump thoughts after lectures
* Screenshot problems
* Jot emotional reactions

Then polish lightly once a week.

---

If you want, I can:

* Design a **weekly template**
* Help you pick a **blog name**
* Draft your **first post**
* Or tailor this to your exact math focus (pure/applied/CS-heavy)

You’re doing something future-you will thank you for.
